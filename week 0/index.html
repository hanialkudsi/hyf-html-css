			<p>Metallica is an American heavy metal band.<br> The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California by drummer Lars Ulrich and vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield, and has been based in San Francisco, California for most of its career.The group's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.<br>
		Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums.The band's third album, Master of Puppets (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums; its eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first to root predominantly in heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, the band returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums.<br>
		Metallica has won nine Grammy Awards and released ten studio albums, three live albums, four extended plays and 24 singles.

			<div id="news3"><h3>Dee Snider: I did not think Metallica would make it</h3>
				<p>Dee Snider has admitted that he did not think Metallica would make it after he saw them performing live early in their career.<br>

The former Twisted Sister vocalist, who released his most recent album For The Love Of Metal last year, was speaking with Detroit radio station WRIF 101.1FM, when he reflected on touring with the thrash giants.<br>

He said: Those motherfuckers earned every fucking dollar they made. They didnot give an inch until they made an alternica record, which I thought was a great record.<br>

This is a true story. We were on tour with Metallica and we were in Holland, and Iam standing on the side of the stage and watching them doing their set. I turn to my bass player and I go, These guys have got a lot of heart, but they are never gonna go anywhere.<br>

Like I said, Iam brutally honest. I said that out loud. What an asshole! I did not want to be against them. I just said, They are so heavy. But they made people just accept how heavy they were, and that is the great thing about Metallica.<br>

For The Love Of Metal features a number of guest musicians and vocalists, including ex Killswitch Engage frontman Howard Jones, Lamb Of God guitarist Mark Morton, Joel Grind and Nick Bellmore from Toxic Holocaust and Arch Enemys Alissa White-Gluz.

				<h3> Lars Ulrich Rocks Out of Marin County Mansion</h3>
				<p>An extravagant mansion long owned by Metallica co-founder and drummer Lars Ulrich, in the posh San Francisco suburb of Tiburon, has come to market at $12 million. Property records indicate the Danish heavy metal maestro has owned the spectacularly sited manse since 1993, when it last changed hands for an unrecorded amount. Presiding over three parcels that together span more than two acres atop the peninsula community highest peak, with cinematic views that sweep over the San Francisco Bay from the downtown skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge, the roughly 13,000-square-foot, more than 25 room transitional contemporary has five and potentially six en suite bedrooms and six full and three half bathrooms (as well as five fireplaces) over four floors.
